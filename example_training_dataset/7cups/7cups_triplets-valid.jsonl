It’s only your life , you must make the most with it! Be happy. Love yourself. Only you can decide what happens in your life. Never allow someone who doesn't support your decision to hurt your happiness! If they aren’t happy for you, or value the person you want to become Id say that’s negativity blocking you from being the real you! You deserve happiness. Everyone does. So promise yourself you’ll always put your happiness first, you deserve it. If someone around you is being negative always tell yourself “This is my life , this is what makes me happy; and this is who I will be.” You have to learn to except the person you want to be first.\nWhen you finally decide to do that everyone else’s opinion about you will no longer matter.", "label": "true"}

Once you start, even if you haven’t relapsed in years, the triggers can still be difficult to ignore. Control is also a huge part of self harm - you can do what you want on your own terms. When everything seems to be out of your control, cutting can be the only thing that is in your power. Even though urges are so tempting, cutting is not healthy! The scars are regrettable and the physical pain DOES NOT take away the emotional pain. Alternatives: breathing techniques, drawing where you feel the urge to cut, tearing up paper, reading a book, listening to music, throwing away all of your self harm equipment. It is easier said than done, but once you’re there, there is no need to look back! It can be done, and I’m proud of you all.", "label": "true"}

You are special in your own way. And people will love you for who you are than pretending to be someone you are not. Most of the time, we compare ourselves to other people because there is something that we want from them that we do not have on ourselves. It causes envy, jealousy and bitterness to creep in your mind and in your heart and is very destructive especially in our relationships. Yes it may be true that sibling rivalry will at some point happen in our lives but to counter that is to first acknowledge your strengths and weaknesses and love yourself. Once you do, love your sibling just as you love yourself. It may sound difficult at first but it takes practice to love someone but you would have to choose to love before it would happen.", "label": "false"}
